                            After years of new user requirements and subsequent data warehouse (DW) evolutions, the Client needed to define a roadmap to evolve its DW platform, cope with its internal usersâ€™ needs and solve infrastructure and technical issues. In particular, the company lacked a clear understanding of its business intelligence landscape and end-user analytic platform. The Client wanted to increase its level of customer service through better quality customer data/information.
